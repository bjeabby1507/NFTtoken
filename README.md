 networks: {
    infura: {

      },
      network_id: 4
    },

* create a new project -ENDPOINTS => Rinkeby/Ropsten/..
* To test with testnet
* get token in a faucet

In the `2_deploy_contracts.js` : choose your metamask address as Admin address
Your account need to have enough gas and ether to deploy the contracts

```shell
# Migrate
truffle migrate --reset --network infura
```
Once the contract is migrated , you can get the contract address in the console
- In Metamask you can add a token with the contract address and the token will be displayed in your metamask
- In MyCrypto choose to interact with your contract in the given testnet , then find the abi in the `build\contracts\MyToken.json` and paste it
- Now you can interact with the contract and test it
- In Metamask send ether to the contract address with Metamsk to get token
